       Locks for mutual exclusion.

       Mutexes  (mutual-exclusion  locks)  are used to implement critical sec‐
       tions and protect shared mutable data structures against concurrent ac‐
       cesses.  The typical use is (if mm is the mutex associated with the data
       structure DD ):
            MMuutteexx..lloocckk mm;;
            ((** CCrriittiiccaall sseeccttiioonn tthhaatt ooppeerraatteess oovveerr DD **));;
            MMuutteexx..uunnlloocckk mm

       The type of mutexes.

       _v_a_l _c_r_e_a_t_e : uunniitt -->> tt

       Return a new mutex.

       _v_a_l _l_o_c_k : tt -->> uunniitt

       Lock the given mutex. Only one thread can have the mutex locked at  any
       time.  A thread that attempts to lock a mutex already locked by another
       thread will suspend until the other thread unlocks the mutex.

       RRaaiisseess  SSyyss__eerrrroorr  if the mutex is already locked by the thread calling

       Same as MMuutteexx..lloocckk , but does not suspend the calling thread if the mu‐
       tex  is  already locked: just return ffaallssee immediately in that case. If
       the mutex is unlocked, lock it and return ttrruuee .

       _v_a_l _u_n_l_o_c_k : tt -->> uunniitt

       Unlock the given mutex. Other threads suspended trying to lock the  mu‐
       tex  will  restart.   The mutex must have been previously locked by the
       thread that calls MMuutteexx..uunnlloocckk .

       BBeeffoorree44..1122

       SSyyss__eerrrroorr was not raised when unlocking an unlocked mutex or  when  un‐
       locking a mutex from a different thread.

       RRaaiisseess  SSyyss__eerrrroorr  if  the  mutex  is unlocked or was locked by another
       thread.
